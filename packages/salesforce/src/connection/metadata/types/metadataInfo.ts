/**
 * This is the base class for all metadata types. You cannot edit this object. 
 * A component is an instance of a metadata type.
 * 
 * Metadata is analogous to sObject, which represents all standard objects. 
 * Metadata represents all components and fields in Metadata API. Instead of identifying 
 * each component with an ID, each custom object or custom field has a unique fullName, 
 * which must be distinct from standard object names, as it must be when you create custom 
 * objects or custom fields in the Salesforce user interface.

    /**
     * The name of the component. If a field, the name must specify the parent object, 
     * for example `Account.FirstName`. The `__c` suffix must be appended to custom object 
     * names and custom field names when you are setting the fullName. For example, 
     * a custom field in a custom object could have a fullName of `MyCustomObject__c.MyCustomField__c`.
     * 
     * To reference a component in a package, prepend the package’s namespace prefix to the 
     * component name in the fullName field. Use the following syntax: `namespacePrefix__ComponentName`. 
     * 
     * For example, for the custom field component `MyCustomObject__c.MyCustomField__c` 
     * and the namespace `MyNS`, the full name is `MyNS__MyCustomObject__c.MyCustomField__c`.
     * 
     * @note _A namespace prefix is a 1-character to 15-character alphanumeric identifier 
     * that distinguishes your package and its contents from other publishers’ packages. 
     * For more information, see "Register a Namespace" in Salesforce Help._
